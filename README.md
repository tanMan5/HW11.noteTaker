For this homework assignment we were to create an application that could be used to write, save, and delete notes.  This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.  To start this homework assignment, we were given some code but needed to create HTML routes, db.json file, and API routes.


## Acceptable Criteria
```
Application should allow users to create and save notes.
Application should allow users to view previously saved notes.
Application should allow users to delete previously saved notes.
```

## What I accomplished

I was able to accomplish all the above acceptable criteria.  Below is an exemple of the application and how certain parts work:
